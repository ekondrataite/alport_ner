# Medical Entity Extraction from Electronic Health Records for Alport Syndrome Patients

This repository contains the code of Eglė Kondrataitė Master's thesis about the use of unstructured medical text and natural language processing techniques for analysis of Alport syndrome.

# Abstract

This Master's thesis demonstrates the development and evaluation of a rule-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for extracting clinically relevant information about Alport Syndrome (AS) patients from unstructured medical text. A specialised dictionary of 33 standardised AS-related terms, validated by a medical expert, was created using ontology-based approach, literature review and medical text analysis. The NER system extracted 18 terms in three categories including diseases, symptoms and procedures. The system recognises synonyms, abbreviations, alternative phrasing and context-specific expressions. Clustering analyses validated the clinical accuracy and interpretability of the extracted information, with algorithms such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN identifying meaningful patient groups, including distinctions between pre-renal failure and renal failure AS patients. The results showed that clustering using all extracted entities provided the most interpretable insights, while smaller feature sets, such as single entity types, provided limited interpretability. Comparative analysis with chronic kidney disease patients demonstrated the system's ability to distinguish between similar diseases, although challenges such as overlapping patient data patterns highlighted areas for improvement. This work provides a novel framework for using unstructured medical text and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to advance research on rare diseases such as AS.
